## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find sum of digits.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define a variables.
3. Write a program to print the sum of the integers in the array.

## Program:
```c
#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
SAVEETHA ENGINEERING COLLEGE
int i,n,sum=0,arr[100]; 
scanf("%d",&n);
{
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
scanf("%d",&arr[i]); 
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
sum=sum+arr[i]; 
i++;
}printf("%d",sum);
}
```
